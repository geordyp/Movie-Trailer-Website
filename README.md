Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

What is it?
-----------

The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a
list of movies titles which is created in "entertainment_center.py" using the
Movie class in "media.py". Then using "fresh_tomatoes.py" the data is served
as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

Running the project
------------
Running the "entertainment_center.py" module will create a list of movies
then pass the list to the "open_movies_page()" function found in
"fresh_tomatoes.py". "fresh_tomatoes.html" will then be created and opened
in the default browser displaying the list of movies created in
"entertainment_center.py"
